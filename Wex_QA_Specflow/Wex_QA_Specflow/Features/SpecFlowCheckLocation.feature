Feature: Returning location data based on country and zip code
  As a consumer of the Zippopotam.us API
  I want to receive location data matching the country code and zip code I supply
  So I can use this data to auto-complete forms on my web site

  Scenario: An existing country and zip code yields the correct place name
    Given the country code us and zip code 90210
    When I request the locations corresponding to these codes
    Then the response contains the place name Beverly Hills

 Scenario: An existing country and zip code yields the right number of results
   Given the country code us and zip code 90210
   When I request the locations corresponding to these codes
   Then the response contains exactly 1 location

  Scenario: An existing country and zip code yields the right HTTP status code
    Given the country code us and zip code 90210
    When I request the locations corresponding to these codes
    Then the response has status code 200
